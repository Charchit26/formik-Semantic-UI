# formik-SemanticField

I found that the very popular `Formik` (https://jaredpalmer.com/formik) library used to build and manage forms in React, is not compatible with Semantic UI (https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

Taking cue from mvanlonden's answer at https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues/148 regarding the same, I modified this wrapper component to use Formik along Semantic components.

An example is also being worked on with associated tests using Enzyme and Jest
